# MapleStory Path Finder
It's a web app for finding paths between two maps in MapleStory.

## Why?
I recently started playing again for the nostalgia (Artale). I was searching for a tool such as this to help me remember to how get to certain maps.
Also be cause it's fun üòÅ

## How to use
Simply choose a starting and end map, click on search and hope it finds a connection between the portals.

## Notes
- Due to some API constraints, some maps cannot be connected. It's best to just search for maps in the same area (Island, World).
- This website is just a hobby project, I can't promise to fix every issue found, but feel free to open PRs.

## API
Thanks to [MapleStory.io](https://maplestory.io) for the API.
