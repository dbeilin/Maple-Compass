# MapleStory Path Finder
It's a web app for finding paths between two maps in MapleStory.

## Why?
I recently started playing again for the nostalgia (Artale) and found myself hopping between different guides to understand how to get to certain places within the game.
Also because I thought it might be fun üòÅ

## How to use
Simply choose a starting and end map, click on search and hope it finds a connection between the portals.

## Notes
- Due to some API constraints, some maps cannot be connected. It's best to just search for maps in the same area (Island, World).
- This website is just a hobby project, I can't promise to fix every issue found, but feel free to open PRs.

## API
Thanks to [MapleStory.io](https://maplestory.io) for the API.
